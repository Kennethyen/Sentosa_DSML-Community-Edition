# 1.Background Description
&emsp;&emsp;Stock prices are an unstable time series that are influenced by multiple factors. There are many external factors that affect the stock market, mainly including economic factors, political factors, and internal factors of the company. Since the emergence of the stock market, researchers have used various methods to study the volatility of stock prices. With the widespread application of mathematical statistics methods and machine learning, more and more people are applying machine learning and other prediction methods to stock prediction, such as neural network prediction, decision tree prediction, support vector machine prediction, logistic regression prediction, etc.
&emsp;&emsp;XGBoost was proposed by TianqiChen in 2016 and has been proven to have low computational complexity, fast running speed, and high accuracy. XGBoost is an efficient implementation of GBDT. When analyzing time series data, although GBDT can effectively improve stock prediction results, due to its relatively slow detection rate, in order to seek a fast and accurate prediction method, the XGBoost model is used for stock prediction, which not only improves prediction accuracy but also increases prediction speed. The XGBoost network model can be used to analyze and predict the closing price of historical stock data, compare the true value with the predicted value, and finally evaluate the effectiveness of the XGBoost model in stock price prediction through an evaluation operator.
&emsp;&emsp;The dataset obtained historical data of stocks (code 510050. SH) from 2005 to 2020 through a crawler. The following table shows the market performance of the stocks over multiple trading days, with the main fields including:

&emsp;&emsp;These fields comprehensively record the daily price fluctuations and trading situations of stocks, which are used for subsequent analysis and prediction of stock trends.

2、Implementation of Sentosa_DSML Community Edition
&emsp;&emsp;The moving average is a commonly used technical indicator that analyzes the price trend of stocks by calculating the moving average, helps identify market trends, and provides reference for trading decisions. Calculate the moving average of a stock's closing price based on different window sizes (5 days, 7 days, 30 days), which can smooth out short-term fluctuations in stock prices and better identify long-term trends. Short term 5-day and 7-day moving averages are typically used to capture short-term trends in stocks and help traders make quick buy or sell decisions. The 30 day moving average represents the medium to long term trend, helping to identify broader market directions. By drawing a chart, one can visually see the closing price and its corresponding moving average, making it easy to observe price changes and trends.
&emsp;&emsp;Using the generated column operator, calculate the value of the new column using the set generated list expression, and set the column names. The generated columns are moveing-avg-5d, moveing-avg-7d, and moveing-avg-30d, representing the moving averages of different periods (5 days, 7 days, 30 days), respectively.
![在这里插入图片描述](https://i-blog.csdnimg.cn/direct/263a0e001cd74945970a0503ab3d2de2.png#pic_center)
&emsp;&emsp;The expression is a SQL window function,
```sql
AVG(`close`) OVER ( ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
AVG(`close`) OVER ( ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
AVG(`close`) OVER ( ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
```
![在这里插入图片描述](https://i-blog.csdnimg.cn/direct/b4de513452d34df1b17b1d151d6d266b.jpeg#pic_center)
&emsp;&emsp;Connect the line chart operator, select the actual closing price and the moving average line, and display the chart.
![在这里插入图片描述](https://i-blog.csdnimg.cn/direct/0f974e84c71544b9ae58933e167799f4.png#pic_center)
&emsp;&emsp;The results are as follows, which allows for a visual representation of the closing price and its corresponding moving average, facilitating the observation of price changes and trends.
![在这里插入图片描述](https://i-blog.csdnimg.cn/direct/ffa25f03d4284c458908ce45cc30ad5d.jpeg#pic_center)
&emsp;&emsp;Reuse the generating column operator to calculate the absolute deviation of stock prices from the moving average of different periods, determine the degree of deviation of the current price from the moving average, and observe the level of deviation. The larger the deviation value, the more intense the price fluctuation, which may be in a strong upward or downward trend. The smaller the deviation value, the closer the price is to the mean, with less volatility, and the market may be in a volatile or sideways phase.
&emsp;&emsp;If the deviation continues to widen, it indicates that the price is far from the mean and may face significant downside risks or be about to break through a certain direction.
&emsp;&emsp;If the deviation begins to narrow, it indicates that the price has returned to the mean, which may indicate that the market trend is stabilizing or reversing.
&emsp;&emsp;Here, the generated column names are set as deviation-MA5, deviation-MA7, and deviation-MA30, respectively, representing the deviations of different periods.
&emsp;&emsp;The expression for generating column values is as follows:
```sql
abs(`close`-` moving_avg_5d`)
abs(`close`-` moving_avg_7d`)
abs(`close`-` moving_avg_29d`)
```

![在这里插入图片描述](https://i-blog.csdnimg.cn/direct/24d018cb889f469fa21003745a7c16c2.png#pic_center)
&emsp;&emsp;Alternatively, chart operators can be used to visualize the deviation values. By visualizing the deviation values and drawing a deviation curve, the deviation trend between the actual closing price and the moving average can be visually presented. This not only helps to reveal the magnitude of market volatility, but also provides important basis for identifying potential price reversals or trend changes, enabling more accurate judgment of market trends, optimizing decision-making processes, and reducing trading risks.

&emsp;&emsp;Then, based on the trading volume, calculate the weighted average price to reflect the average trading price of the stock during a specific time period, taking into account the impact of trading volume. The calculation formula is to multiply the closing price (close) of a stock by the trading volume (vol), and then calculate the cumulative sum of weighted closing prices, divided by the cumulative sum of trading volume.
&emsp;&emsp;Use the generate column operator to set column names and construct a generate list expression to calculate the weighted average of trading volume.
![在这里插入图片描述](https://i-blog.csdnimg.cn/direct/b09fd5bfe19945648eab1203a7801008.png#pic_center)
&emsp;&emsp;When the closing price of a stock is greater than the volume weighted average, signal is set to 1, indicating a buy signal and a strong stock price.
&emsp;&emsp;When the closing price of a stock is less than or equal to the volume weighted average, the signal is 0, indicating weakness and can be used for short selling or staying on the sidelines. This signal can serve as a simple strategy to guide trading decisions.
&emsp;&emsp;Using the selection operator, apply the expression 'trade_date' to the data` Close '>' Weighted Average of Trading Volume 'selects data.

## (3) Sample partitioning
1、Implementation in Python code
&emsp;&emsp;Preprocess and sequentially partition data.
```python
def preprocess_data(dataset, columns_to_exclude, label_column):
    if label_column not in dataset.columns:
        raise ValueError(f"Label column '{label_column}' not found in dataset.")
    dataset[columns_to_exclude] = None

    for column in columns_to_convert:
        if column in dataset.columns:
            dataset[column] = pd.to_numeric(dataset[column], errors='coerce')
        else:

    dataset.fillna(0, inplace=True)
    return dataset
```
```python
def split_data(dataset, label_column, train_ratio=0.8):
    dataset.sort_values(by='trade_date', ascending=True, inplace=True)
    split_index = int(len(dataset) * train_ratio)

    train_set = dataset.iloc[:split_index]
    test_set = dataset.iloc[split_index:]

    return train_set, test_set
```
```python
def prepare_dmatrix(train_set, test_set, label_column):
    if label_column not in train_set.columns or label_column not in test_set.columns:
        raise ValueError(f"Label column '{label_column}' must be in both training and testing sets.")

    dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(train_set.drop(columns=[label_column]), label=train_set[label_column])
    dtest = xgb.DMatrix(test_set.drop(columns=[label_column]), label=test_set[label_column])

    return dtrain, dtest

```
2、Implementation of Sentosa_DSML Community Edition
&emsp;&emsp;When processing data, converting the trade_date column from int type to timestamp type can be accomplished by concatenating two formatting operators. First, convert the int type date to a string, and then convert the string to timestamp type.

y_test_pred = model.predict(dtest)
```

```python
def calculate_metrics(y_true, y_pred):
    r2 = r2_score(y_true, y_pred)
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)
    rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred))

2、Implementation of Sentosa_DSML Community Edition

&emsp;&emsp;Firstly, the XGBoost regression operator was selected and relevant parameters were set for model training, using root mean square error (RMSE) as the metric to evaluate model performance. We constructed an XGBoost prediction model and applied it to predict the closing price of stocks. It is also possible to connect other regression models for training, compare the prediction results of the XGBoost model with those of other models, and validate and evaluate the performance of each model through model evaluation metrics such as R ², MAE, RMSE, etc.

&emsp;&emsp;The XGBoost stock prediction model performs well on the training set with small errors, indicating that the model can fit the training data well. The evaluation results on the test set are also relatively ideal, with MAE of 0.054, RMSE of 0.093, MAPE and SMAPE of 1.8% and 1.7% respectively, indicating that the model has a small prediction error on the test set, good generalization ability, and can accurately predict the closing price of stocks. The model performs stably in both balanced training set fitting and test set generalization.

&emsp;&emsp;Connect the sequence diagram operator to visually compare the stock closing price predicted by the XGBoost model with the actual closing price, display each sequence separately, and generate a sequence comparison curve graph. Through this method, the difference between the model prediction and the actual data can be visually observed, thereby evaluating the performance and reliability of the model. This is very important in data prediction as it helps identify whether the model can accurately capture market trends.

&emsp;&emsp;This graph contains two time series curves, which respectively show the comparison of the predicted value (Predicted_close) and the actual value (close) over a period of time. It displays the trend of the predicted stock closing price over time. The overall trend of the two curves is similar, especially in large fluctuation areas (such as the peak period around 2008 and the subsequent decline period), indicating that the predictive performance of the model is close to the actual value. This chart visually displays the time series comparison between the predicted and actual values of the model, helping to evaluate whether the performance of the model is in line with the actual market trend.
