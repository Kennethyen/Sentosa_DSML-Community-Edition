1.The Sentosa_DSML Community Edition is a data intelligence analysis and mining platform that enables the rapid establishment of predictive models using commercial technologies and their application to business activities, thereby improving decision-making processes. Designed with reference to the industry-standard CRISP-DM model, the Sentosa_DSML Community Edition supports the entire data mining process from raw data to enhanced business outcomes.
2.The Sentosa_DSML Community Edition offers various modeling methods leveraging machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistics. Through the methods in the modeling palette, you can generate new information from data and develop predictive models. Each method has its strengths and is suitable for solving specific types of problems. It provides a comprehensive set of algorithms, integrated into the platform in a pluggable, modular, and stackable manner. It also offers complete architecture support for setting up, orchestrating, running, and deploying operators, allowing users to visually stack operators based on actual business scenarios to quickly build models.
3.The Sentosa_DSML Community Edition has broad applications in AI and big data. Users can connect historical or real-time data to the platform in the form of data views for data source management, metric definition, data tracing, and data monitoring. Within the embedded Sentosa_DSML Community Edition, data is processed in the form of operator flows, including data reading and writing, row processing, column processing, feature engineering, data fusion, machine learning algorithms, and graphical analysis. Trained models can be stored, updated, previewed, and validated.
4.Based on existing big data analytics technologies such as Spark and k8s, the Sentosa_DSML Community Edition visualizes the algorithms required in traditional big data analytics processes as operators. Operators are functional models that can implement independent data processing logic and have a unified interface. In the Sentosa platform, different data input methods, data analysis models, and data output methods are abstracted as different operators, such as data reading operators, K-means operators, decision tree operators, and data export operators.
5.Based on data analysis, the Sentosa_DSML Community Edition is capable of "aggregating points into surfaces," actively associating related information in different types of analyzed data and mining individual information with associations across different databases.

Sentosa Data Science and Machine Learning Platform (Sentosa_DSML) is a one-stop AI development, deployment, and application platform with full intellectual property rights owned by Liwei Intelligent Connectivity.
